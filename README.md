# admin-dashboard
This is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)
curriculum. The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with the usage of grid.
Therefore, I mostly avoided using flexbox.

I designed my own color scheme to make the project a bit more unique. The orange
color is associated with options/links related to projects, while blue is associated
with everything else. I chose these colors because they are complementary and 
look quite nice when put together.
